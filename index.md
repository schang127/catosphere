### Unique Features

This game consists of a series of platforms and ladders with stars along the platforms. The objective of the game is to collect the stars and move up the ladders to reach the top of the screen. The cat starts out with 9 lives and 0 points. Each star collected increases your score by 10 points. Additionally, there are fireballs falling from the top of the screen. If you collide with a fireball you lose a life and so the player has to avoid the fireballs as they are moving up the screen. When you reach the top of the screen the board updates so that you can keep going. The game ends when you lose all your lives and your final score is displayed.
